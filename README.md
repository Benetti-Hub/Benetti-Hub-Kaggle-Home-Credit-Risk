# Kaggle Home Credit Risk Competition

Welcome to the repository for my participation in the [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability). This project aims to build a predictive model to evaluate the credit risk of loan applicants.

**Achievement**: I ranked 93rd out of 3,858 participants in the competition

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our solution. The development and experimentation were conducted primarily on Google Colab and Kaggle Notebooks. Consequently, the code is designed to run within these environments and is not structured as a fully-fledged, production-ready machine learning pipeline.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Placeholder for datasets. Note that datasets should be downloaded directly from Kaggle as they are not included in this repository.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages to replicate the environment.

## Getting Started

To replicate our results or use our code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Benetti-Hub/Kaggle-Home-Credit-Risk-Competition.git
    cd Kaggle-Home-Credit-Risk-Competition
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the dataset from Kaggle:**
    - Go to the [Home Credit Default Risk competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability).
    - Download the datasets and place them in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run the notebooks:**
    - Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory using Google Colab or a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Notes

- This project is intended for educational purposes and is focused on the development and evaluation of machine learning models within notebook environments.
- The code is not structured as a deployable machine learning pipeline. For production use, further refactoring and optimization would be necessary.
